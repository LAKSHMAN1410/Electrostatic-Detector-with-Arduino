⚡ Electrostatic Detector with Arduino

📖 Overview

The Electrostatic Detector with Arduino is a real-time static electricity monitoring system built using Arduino Uno, a capacitive antenna, and an LCD display. Static electricity, though invisible, can cause equipment damage, malfunctions, or safety hazards in sensitive environments such as electronics labs, cleanrooms, and manufacturing plants.

This project demonstrates a low-cost, DIY solution for detecting electrostatic charge buildup and providing instant feedback through LED indicators, a buzzer, and display messages. Its non-contact detection capability makes it both safe and reliable.

🔬 Introduction

Static electricity is an ever-present phenomenon that can damage sensitive electronic components, cause malfunctions, or even create safety hazards.
This project aims to provide a low-cost, real-time detection system using Arduino Uno and basic components. The detector alerts users about electrostatic charge buildup with a buzzer, LED, and LCD readout.

🎯 Objectives

Detect electrostatic charge using a capacitive sensor/antenna.

Process signals with an Arduino Uno microcontroller.

Provide real-time visual (LED + LCD) and audio (buzzer) feedback.

Create a cost-effective, user-friendly design for education and industry.

🔬 Working Principle

Electrostatic detection is based on the following physics concepts:

1. Electric Field of Charges – A charged body creates an electric field around it.


2. Capacitive Coupling – A nearby antenna (copper wire) senses this field as a small change in capacitance.


3. Voltage Induction – The changing capacitance induces a voltage, measurable by Arduino.


4. Signal Processing – Arduino compares the signal to a threshold.


5. Alert Mechanism – If charge is detected, LED turns ON, buzzer sounds, and LCD shows “DETECTING.”



This system allows non-contact detection, avoiding direct discharge to the sensor.
